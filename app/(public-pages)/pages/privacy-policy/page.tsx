        WearMe respects the privacy of the users of its website and considers
        their safety a priority. We commit ourselves to ensuring that we treat

        parties where this is not stated separately. We seek to protect your
        rights of privacy on systems and the Site controlled by us, but we are
        not liable for any unauthorized or unlawful disclosures of your personal
        and confidential information made by third parties who are not subject
        to our controlâ€”for example, advertisers and websites that have links to
        our Site.
